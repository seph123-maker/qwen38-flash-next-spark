"""MTP drafter: skip non-MTP tensors before they are read (VLLM_MTP_NAME_PREFILTER=1, default on).

The drafter is loaded as a second model from the same checkpoint. Its loader walks all 299,845
tensors of the 11 files and Qwen3_8FlashNextMTP.load_weights keeps the ~3,100 whose name
_remap_mtp_weight_name maps, discarding the rest after they were created; with patch 15 that
means after they were read (~70 GiB). vLLM's safetensors iterator already asks
weight_utils.should_skip_weight(name, ...) before reading each tensor; this wraps it with an
optional keep-filter, and the drafter's load_weights sets it to its own name function while it
loads. The kept names are exactly the ones the drafter would have kept (same function, same names:
the primary checkpoint source has an empty prefix; with secondary sources the filter is not used).
src/test_mtp_prefilter_cpu.py checks the kept set against the checkpoint index."""
