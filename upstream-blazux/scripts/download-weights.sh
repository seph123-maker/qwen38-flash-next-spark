# Resumable — safe to re-run if the connection drops, and safe to interrupt: partial
# blobs are kept as .incomplete and resumed where they left off.
#
#   scripts/download-weights.sh                    # the default checkpoint, nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 (~124 GiB, Xet)
#   MODEL=RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 scripts/download-weights.sh   # the previous default (~122 GiB, 418 files)
#   MODEL=<org/name> scripts/download-weights.sh   # some other checkpoint
#   MODEL=<org/name> EXCLUDE='glob1 glob2' scripts/download-weights.sh
#   MAX_WORKERS=24 scripts/download-weights.sh     # more parallel connections
#   XET=0 scripts/download-weights.sh              # plain HTTPS instead of Xet (see below)
#
# EXCLUDE takes space-separated globs and skips those files -- for a checkpoint
# where you already have an equivalent copy of one large shard, or do not intend to
# serve it. On some checkpoints the PLE n-gram table alone is a ~102 GB shard, so
# skipping one file can halve the download. Only skip a shard you can account for:
# the index still names it, so whatever consumes the checkpoint has to be told
# where those tensors live instead.
#
# XET=1 (the default since 2026-09-13) uses the Xet backend; XET=0 falls back to plain HTTPS.
# Xet used to be off because it stalled on some Spark setups, but the Hub now refuses to
# serve files over 50 GB through the plain path at all (the NVIDIA checkpoint's PLE table is a
# single 50 GiB shard, and the error it prints -- "install hf_xet" -- is misleading: hf_xet is
# in the image, HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1 was what blocked it). Measured here on a DGX Spark:
# ~105 MB/s with Xet against ~15 MB/s without, two clean exits. If Xet stalls for you, XET=0.
# On a fast link the difference is large: --max-workers only parallelises across *files*,
# so a checkpoint of a dozen large shards leaves most of a gigabit idle over plain HTTPS,
# while Xet issues concurrent ranged reads *within* each file. Measured here on a DGX
# Spark on gigabit fibre, pulling 81 GB of orcarouter/...-Uncensored-NVFP4:
#
#     plain HTTPS, 8 workers    14.7 MB/s   (117 Mbit/s)
#     XET=1                    101   MB/s   (809 Mbit/s, ~86% of line rate) -- 13.4 min
#
# Caveat, and why it stays off by default: that run still ended in an httpx.ReadTimeout
# after the last file finished. Every blob was complete and verified, but the exit code
# was non-zero, so a wrapper that trusts it will think the download failed. Re-run to
# confirm -- it is resumable and a completed download re-checks in seconds.
# Xet-backed repos are the ones whose API tree entries carry an "xetHash".
#
# MAX_WORKERS is worth raising when the Hub, rather than your link, is the limit.
# Check which it is: measure the NIC while the download runs
# (/sys/class/net/<if>/statistics/rx_bytes), then run a few parallel streams from an
# unrelated CDN. If the total goes well above what the download alone was getting,
# there is headroom and more workers will use it; if it does not, the pipe is full and
# more workers only add overhead.
#
# The default checkpoint needs ~140 GB free on the filesystem holding
# ~/.cache/huggingface; check the model's own file list for others.
#
# Gated repos: run `hf auth login` once. The token lands in the HF cache, which is
# mounted into the container, so it is picked up without exporting HF_TOKEN.
